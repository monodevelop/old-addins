== MonoDevelop iPhone Addin ==

== Building and running the addin ==

The addin currently must be built against a trunk build of MonoDevelop.
This currently means it must either
a) be built and installed against an installed trunk build of MonoDevelop
b) built as part of the extras development-time build system [RECOMMENDED]

To build as part of extras, use the top-level "configure --select" to 
enable it (or append it to profiles/default directly).

It should now be possible to build and run the addin with "make && make run"
Some of the functionality will run on Linux and Windows, for example creating 
and editing projects. Building and deploying, and editing user interfaces,
only work on the Mac.


== Building a MonoDevelop.app package ==

Either use the mac profile, or append --enable-macplatform after "main"
in the profiles/default profile, and build MonoDevelop. Go to the directory
main/build/MacOSX and run "make MonoDevelop.app"

The commands "make MonoDevelop.app.zip" and "make-dmg-bundle.sh" can be used 
to make zip or dmg bundles. The latter command only works on the Mac.


== Including the addin into a MonoDevelop.app package==

Create the directory Contents/MacOS/lib/monodevelop/AddIns/MonoDevelop.IPhone
within the MonoDevelop.app, and copy all of the files from
MonoDevelop.IPhone/build to that directory.
