High priority:
* Package publishing wizard to sign release build with release key

Medium priority:
* Check whether target device had enough temp space (e.g. emulator)
* Figure out how to associate virtual devices and running emulators, 
  and improve the device selector GUI.
* Set asset build action automatically when adding files to Asset folder
* More options GUIs as needed - add options GUIs for any 
  additional build options, such as the linker.

Low priority:
* Make the device log view window into a pad, like the VS addin.
* Filtering for the device log. Not sure whether to handle it with
  args to adb, or filtering adb's output.
* Unify the android and iphone device log pads.
* Code completion for GUI definition xml files. Should be possible
  to drive it from code completion db like the XAML completion.
* Code completion schema for AndroidManifest.xml (maybe Eclipse
  has one?)
* Debugger visualizers & formatters for android types
* Unit testing integration & templates

There are also misc minor FIXMEs and TODOs in the source.
