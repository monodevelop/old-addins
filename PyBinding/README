This addin provides support for the standard cPython runtime.  It is in no
way supporting IronPython.  If you wish to have IronPython support, look
at bringing PythonBinding up to date.  The reason for this is that an
IronPython binding would want to inherit DotNetProject and that makes no
sense for cPython.
